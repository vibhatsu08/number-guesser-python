# number-guesser-python
This repository is for hosting the number guesser project in python.

ProjectLog[0] - Working on the first prototype of the number guessing game. This prototype literally has no functions, just random lines of code here and there. Most likely will scrap this code, for a better version of the game, by the next project log. </br>
ProjectLog[1] - First function will be to initiate the start of the game. Implemented functions for the game. The functions for the game include, 1) start of the game 2) choosing the number by the computer 3) initializing the game, and 4) guessing the number game.</br>
