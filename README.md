# number-guesser-python
This repository is for hosting the number guesser project in python.

ProjectLog[0] - Working on the first prototype of the number guessing game. This prototype literally has no functions, just random lines of code here and there. Most likely will scrap this code, for a better version of the game, by the next project log. </br>
