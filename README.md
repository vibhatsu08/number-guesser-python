# number-guesser-python
This repository is for hosting the number guesser project in python.

ProjectLog[0] - Working on the first prototype of the number guessing game. This prototype literally has no functions, just random lines of code here and there. Most likely will scrap this code, for a better version of the game, by the next project log. </br>
ProjectLog[1] - First function will be to initiate the start of the game. Implemented functions for the game. The functions for the game include, 1) start of the game 2) choosing the number by the computer 3) initializing the game, and 4) guessing the number game.</br>
ProjectLog[2] - Scrapped the whole function for older code with a newer approach to handle the attempts being made to guess the number, now the attempts will be recorded until the user correctly guesses the correct number. Same goes for the gameOver function. </br>
ProjectLog[3] - Completed the final build of the program, now will be working on improving the program, and removing any kind of bugs. </br>
ProjectLog[4] - Added some changes to the statements throughout the game, to make it a little more polished. </br>
ProjectLog[5] - Used the time module to add a little bit of a graceful delay to the program, to give it a more of a retro vibe. </br>
